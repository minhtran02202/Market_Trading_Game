# Market_Trading_Game

This program let the user choose to be one of three civilizations: agriculture, metropolitan, or industrial. 
They will then have to trade with the other 2 civilizations.

If the user can reach $10,000 in the balance before user 20 turns, they will win.

In this project, I learned about dynamic casting. I found that this is a powerful concept that can help me minimizing 
the amount of code needed when writing the client program in the main.cpp file. Dynamic casting is a tool that I think 
I will use more and more of.

This is a really fun project that lets me learn alot about Object Oriented Programming and how to design a simple game.
