# Market_Trading_Game

This program let the user choose to be one of three civilizations: agriculture, metropolitan, or industrial. 
They will then have to trade with the other 2 civilizations.

If the user can reach $10,000 in the balance before the 20th turns, they will win.

In this project, I learned about dynamic casting. I found that this is a powerful concept that can help me minimizing 
the amount of code needed when writing the client program in the main.cpp file. 

This program data structure is double linked list.

This is a really fun project that lets me learn alot about Object Oriented Programming and how to design a simple game.
